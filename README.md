Hi ðŸ‘‹
My name is Alejandro
Currently i'm living in Mexico city
I'm a psychologist but i've been always interested in the IT world. Right now, i'm working on an IT company, so step by step, i immersed myself with some courses of HTML/CSS and testing.
I started studing data analysis since september 2023, and i'm looking to incorporate in this very interesting and constantly growing world of data
Time to time i'll load the projects i've been doing on this path
